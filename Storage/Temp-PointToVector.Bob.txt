What is wrong with this shit. I really do not understand why the rotation is backwards. 
Is it just LU or what I mean damn why https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Compass_rose.png

It shouldn't be backwards. Anyway I implimented a fix to it in the scripts. 

At the bottom of the page you will see some command. Put one vector on one side. And the next on the other. When you enter the command it will 
point to this vector. It's doggy and there was no real time way to add with atan. So fuck it. 

Since it's figured out I will try to do some more in depths

I could add up to 18 angles if I want really..

This is not the corrent way. This is not static data. I plan to do this the right way another day. Some issues with

atan(x,y - atan(x,y)
